Lift Control OpenFAST & Stabilization - A model-free based control perspective
==============================================================================

The Lift Control OpenFAST & Stabilization program, associated with MatlabⓇ and SimulinkⓇ, 
aims to easily use the simulation software “OpenFAST” in order to develop 
advanced control algorithms dedicated to improve the stability and efficiency of 
the wind turbines dynamics. A particular model-free based control technique is 
experimented to control the aerodynamic lift at the blade scale in several aerodynamic conditions.

A user guide presents the program and describes its features including some examples.
